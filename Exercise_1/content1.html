<h1>TRIATHLON HISTORY</h1>	

	<p>Triathlon as a sport is still relatively new, having its roots in France in the 1920s. Competitors participated in a race called “Les trois sports” – translated literally to “Three Sports” – which consisted of crossing the channel Marne, a 12K bike ride and a 3K run. In 1934, the race was consisted of crossing the channel, a 10K bike ride and a 1200 meter run.</p>
	
	<p> <a href="content2.html">WHAT IS A TRIATHLON?</a></p>
	
	<p>Here’s an overview of some of the general rules applicable to all three disciplines:
		
		<ul>
	
			<li>If participants leave the marked course for any reason, they must reenter the course at the same spot they left it.</li>
			<li>No outside assistance from anyone other than a race official.</li>
			<li>Don't do anything that endangers yourself or any other participants. </li>
			<li>No headsets or personal audio devices – iPods, mp3 players, etc. – may be used at any time during the race.</li>
			<li>No glass containers anywhere on the race at anytime. Violation of this rule results in disqualification.</li>
	
		</ul>

	<p>Triathlons in America can be traced to Southern California in the 1970s. The first Mission Bay Triathlon was held on September 25, 1974 in San Diego. This is the date that most hold to be the official “birthday” of the modern triathlon. There were 46 people that showed up to compete in the multisport event consisting of a 500-yard swim, a 5-mile bike ride, and a 6-mile run.</p>

	<p>As the sport started to catch on more and more, the beginnings of the most famous triathlon in the world began to unfold in Hawaii. Three separate events – the Waikiki Rough Water Swim (2.4 miles), The Oahu Bike Race (112 miles) and The Honolulu Marathon (26.2 miles) – were combined in 1978 to form the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. Of the 15 competitors who started the race, only 12 of them crossed the finish line. By the early 1982, ABC’s Wide World of Sports was broadcasting the Hawaii Ironman and nearly 600 people entered</p>
